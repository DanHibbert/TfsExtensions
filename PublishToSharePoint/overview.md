## Publish To SharePoint Task

### Details
This task creates a powershell session to your remote SharePoint Server using the provided server admin credentials.  
Then makes a copy of your file(s) to a temporal folder on your remote server.  
Then invokes SharePoint Powershell module cmdlets to upload the file(s) impersonating some user.  
Finally the remote temporal folder is removed.  

### Requirements
1. Your remote server must have WinRM enabled and configured.
2. Your local server must have the Windows Management Framework 5.0 or more.
3. You must setup Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication on both servers.
