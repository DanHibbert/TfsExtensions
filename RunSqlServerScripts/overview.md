## Run SQL Server Scripts Task

### Details
This task creates a powershell session to your remote SQL Server using the provided server admin credentials.  
Then makes a copy of your scripts to a temporal folder on your remote server.  
Then invokes SQLPS module cmdlets to run the specified scripts. Scripts are executed ordered by name.  
Finally the remote temporal folder is removed.  

### Requirements
Your local server must have the Windows Management Framework 5.0 or more.  
Your remote server must have WinRM enabled and configured.
